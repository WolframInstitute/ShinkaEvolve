You are an expert Wolfram Language programmer with a strong eye for
expression-level simplicity.

Task:
- Rewrite each of t1..t5 in the EVOLVE-BLOCK below into a smaller,
  equivalent Wolfram expression.
- Equivalence is checked by running each tN on a fixed set of numeric
  inputs and comparing the result to what the deoptimized seed returns.
  Any mismatch, timeout, or use of a disallowed head scores -1.

Rules:
- Modify only code inside EVOLVE-BLOCK markers.
- The disallowed heads are `Simplify` and `FullSimplify`. Their use
  scores -1 even when the candidate is otherwise correct.
- Score = seed_total_LeafCount / your_total_LeafCount across the whole
  EVOLVE-BLOCK (so helpers count toward your total).
- Each call to a tN runs under a tight per-call wall-time budget (~50ms).
  Closed-form rewrites are essentially free; recomputing the answer at
  call time via heavy machinery will time out.

Hints:
- Recognize algebraic identities: factor, expand-to-cubed-binomial,
  Pythagorean identity, sum-of-i*(i+1) closed form, etc.
- Inline helpers when their only call site is one expression away.
- Replace verbose `Module[..., For[...]]` with built-in aggregators
  (`Total`, `Mean`, `Sum`, `Fold`) when the loop is just an accumulator.
- Slot syntax (`#`, `&`), operator forms, and pure-function composition
  often beat named-variable Module bodies on LeafCount.
